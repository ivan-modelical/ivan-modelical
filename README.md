### Hola mundo ðŸ‘‹

I am an architect that loves building code as much as building actual buildings.

Currrently I specialize on BIM tooling and problem solving for different clientes in Modelical.

My preferred language is Python ![ICON](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg). 
C# is understood, although I am by no means an expert.
